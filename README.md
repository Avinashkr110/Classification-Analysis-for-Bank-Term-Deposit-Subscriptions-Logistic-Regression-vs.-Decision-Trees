### Project Overview: Bank Term Deposit Subscription Classification
This project centers around predicting customer behavior regarding term deposit subscriptions within a banking context. The primary goal is to build a predictive model capable of classifying whether a customer will subscribe to a bank's term deposit or not. The dataset provided includes both training and test data, enabling the development and validation of the predictive models.

### Methodology
The project utilizes two prominent machine learning algorithms—Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier—to construct predictive models. These models are trained on the provided training dataset, leveraging customer attributes and historical subscription data to learn patterns and make predictions.

### Model Performance: 
- Logistic Regression Model: Achieved an accuracy of 89.1% during training.
- Decision Tree Classifier: Showcased higher performance, achieving an accuracy of 90.4% during training.
### Test Results:
Upon evaluating the models on the test dataset, a commendable overall accuracy of 90.88% was achieved. This suggests that the models generalized well to unseen data, demonstrating their reliability in predicting customer term deposit subscriptions.
